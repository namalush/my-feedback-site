            <h2>About the Seller</h2>
            <p><strong>Store Name:</strong> <a href="https://dajimen.en.alibaba.com/" target="_blank">Guangdong Daji Doors Industry Co., Ltd.</a></p>
            <p><strong>Contact Person:</strong> George DJMI</p>
            <p>This company specializes in manufacturing and selling folding doors, soundproof doors, and other door solutions. Their advertised products claim high functionality and quality standards.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Background of the Dispute</h2>
            <p>I purchased 8 sets of folding doors from Guangdong Daji Doors Industry Co., Ltd. for use in residential spaces, specifically bedrooms. The seller assured me that the doors would meet my requirements for soundproofing and proper fit. However, upon receiving the product, I encountered multiple issues, including poorly fitting doors, large gaps, and missing essential components such as pre-drilled holes for locks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Issues</h2>
            <h3>1. Gaps and Poor Construction</h3>
            <p>The design of the door frames and the folding mechanism left significant gaps between the doors and the frames, making them unsuitable for bedroom use. Despite assurances from the seller, the product did not meet the advertised specifications.</p>
            <h3>2. Missing Lock Holes in Door Frames</h3>
            <p>The doors came with pre-drilled holes for locks, but none of the frames (door jambs) had corresponding holes for the lock latch. When I raised this issue, the seller suggested that I drill the holes myself and even recommended a tool to purchase for this purpose. This level of unfinished work is unacceptable and not in line with standard industry practices.</p>
            <h3>3. Misleading Evidence from the Seller</h3>
            <p>The seller submitted a video during the dispute that was not shared with me prior to the sale. The video was shot from angles that obscured the gaps, giving the false impression that the doors fit properly. However, even in this video, some gaps are still visible, further demonstrating the product's flaws.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Correspondence with the Seller</h2>
            <p>The communication process with the seller has been frustrating and prolonged. Despite nearly a year of discussions, the seller has failed to resolve the issues or take accountability for the defective product. Below are the main points of the correspondence:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial assurances that the doors would be soundproof and suitable for bedrooms.</li>
                <li>Claims that all issues had been fixed before shipping, which proved to be untrue upon delivery.</li>
                <li>Denial of responsibility and refusal to offer a replacement or refund.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Customer Request</h2>
            <p>I am requesting one of the following resolutions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Full Replacement:</strong> Replace all eight sets of folding doors and frames with properly constructed doors that meet the advertised quality and functionality. All replacement and shipping costs should be covered by the seller.</li>
                <li><strong>Full Refund:</strong> If replacement is not feasible, I request a full refund, including all shipping expenses.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Photo and Video Evidence</h2>
            <p>The following images and videos illustrate the issues described above:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Photos showing gaps between the doors and frames.</li>
                <li>Videos demonstrating the poor fit and missing lock holes.</li>
            </ul>
